### What I have Learned 
* Next js
choosed Next as it is server side rendering, preloaded with many things while deploying production_Ready app.
* TypeScript
Typescript because it helps to write less error-prone code , is decomentation in itself and helps with project-maintenance far into the future.
* Tailwindcss
used tailwindcss in ways of @apply and @layer in some fields to make the code more cleaner but didn't use it too much to not throw away all of workflow and maintainability that tailwind gives.
